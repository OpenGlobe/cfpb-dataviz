Chord diagrams help show relationships in a fluid format. This folder contains:

- chord.js -- the plug-in necessary to make the magic happen, this is called by the html file
- index.html -- contains all the data from example.json, also calls all the right methods to visualize the diagram
- processing.R -- a simple R script to process the data into the appropriate format 
- example.json -- example data
