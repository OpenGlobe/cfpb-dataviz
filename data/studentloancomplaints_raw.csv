Total balance of the Wells Fargo loan as of XX/XX/XXXX is {$82000.00} and rising because of late fees and more interest. Immediately after graduation I took the XXXX job that came starting at $ XXXX. ( $ XXXX. ). Continued to apply weekly to jobs hoping to get something in my field or at least make more money. Put aside as much as possible in preparation for the loan repayments to begin. Discussed payment options XX/XX/XXXX with Wells Fargo before the grace period ended and I would start to repay the loan. I was told that I could apply for consolidation and refinance 30 days before the XXXX payment is due. The month of XX/XX/XXXX I applied for the consolidation & refinance with Wells Fargo. I was denied because of my salary and my parents ( who are co-signers for my Wells Fargo loan ) were also denied. XX/XX/XXXX loan repayment was to begin. Bill was sent for the total monthly amount of both loans {$920.00}. I did not have the full amount to pay, so at the time when I was making $ XXXX I sent them all that I could. We called Wells Fargo and they said that there was nothing they could do since we did not qualify for consolidation that I must pay the full {$920.00} or I will be in default. In XX/XX/XXXX started a job at $ XXXX. ( $ XXXX. ), but I still ca n't pay the full {$920.00}, so I am now paying the full {$350.00} for the XXXX loan and paying a portion of the XXXX loan, which I can afford $ XXXX {$200.00}. Since XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo has continuously called my cell, my parents ' cells and my home phone. As of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Wells Fargo started a new tactic. They called my company 's work phone, which could make me an undesirable employee and an unemployed person who would no longer be able to continue paying what I am currently sending. XXXX of the many calls that my father answered he explained that no one asked for any expenses, they just looked at the salaries of my parents. All the requested documents were sent and then denied. I do n't understand why Wells Fargo would rather continue the harassing phone calls to collect the full {$920.00}, instead of working with me to reach a reasonable monthly payment, which by now they should be painfully aware that this is all I have to send them. I have not missed a due date and I continue to send them the amount I previously stated. Even though I am sending only a portion, I do intend to pay in full my loan responsibility with some reasonable assistance from Wells Fargo. For being out of school a little over a year, my credit is ruined. And now my parents ' credit score is affected because of this default situation, too. We have continuously and exhaustively spoken to Wells Fargo for 7 months and they have made no effort to alter their demands for full payment. The couple of times that someone has pointed us in a direction of a department that may be able to help, has only resulted in an immediate rejection and with a  sorry but there is nothing we can do ''. We did receive a letter where they stated  we have tried to work with you ''. They have done everything but. If you consider constant harassing phone calls working with us, then we have a different definition of the term  working with you ''. This is beyond frustrating and hopeless. We are not deadbeats. I absolutely want to pay every penny that I owe. I am not asking for Forgiveness for the loan, but a monthly payment that I can afford with the goal to get out of being in default so I can have a modicum of some future at XXXX years old.

Again, my MOTHER was brought into the conversation and how she could pay half and WE could call her and explain that this needed to be paid. Scare tactics and bullying AGAIN. So, I agreed to the arrangement and I ca n't afford it. I thought about this arrangement for days and called back on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX to speak with someone who may understand my situation. I thought I could get through to someone who could work with me. I was wrong. The XXXX man I spoke with listened and was cordial. He had to transfer me to someone else. I got transferred to another male. I explained my situation and he listened. He then proceeded to bring up my mother. How she should help because she co-signed and how I needed to get money from her. He asked what I made a year and I said about XXXX and after taxes and insurance it was around $ XXXX every XXXX weeks, not a lot for XXXX VA area. He did n't believe me. I offered to send pay stubs. He said it did n't matter. Again, they bought this loan for pennies on the dollar. He offered a XXXX arrangement of almost {$300.00} a month for XXXX months, no settlement if I lower payments. He bullied me again. I want you to be aware of their predatory practices and that they use scare tactics to make a profit off of your debt. I would be happy to pay monthly if the payments are reasonable.

I was never instructed that there are differences between federal and private loans. I was never told about the differences in repayment and assumed all student loans were equal. It was logical, all my loans ( except for XXXX ) were coming from XXXX XXXX. Now looking back it is insane to me that we are asking XXXX year old kids, with little to no exposure to even running their own basic budgets, to navigate the complicated intricacies of loans and repayment programs. The market crashed in XX/XX/XXXX, I graduated in XX/XX/XXXX. It took me a very long time to find a career and a job where I could afford to pay my student loans. Needless to say, I left school $ XXXX in debt with XXXX degrees, and could not find a job. I had no idea, but interest was piling up on all the loans I had acquired. I have, since then, found a career where I make a good amount of money. However, it is impossible to get out from under the student loan debt. I have paid XXXX of my loans on auto-debit for XXXX years straight. The original amount of the loan was $ XXXX. I have been paying $ XXXX $ XXXX on auto debit for XXXX years. My principal balance is now {$14000.00}. AFTER XXXX YEARS OF PAYMENT. I am frustrated and overwhelmed. It is not SIMPLE interest, like my home loan, but rather compound interest. I NEVER would have taken out student loans if this was explained to me as an XXXX year old. I had to BUY A HOME, to understand the difference between the types of interest. The concept of simple vs compound interest was never explained to me and as a result, even though my salary is high, I have very little ability to pay off these loans. It is a travesty of the education system that those concepts are not explained to people. Even with the salary I have, I am UNABLE to make the payments and as a result, set up for financial failure. How is this fair? I am trying to get ahead but frankly I have paid more down on my house and car in XXXX years than I have in XXXX years on my student loan. Should n't this stop?

I graduated medical school in XXXX, & received superb scores on all United States XXXX XXXX XXXX, but was unable to obtain a resident position, & therefore, never able to become a board certified physician. I acquired a 1 year internship, & completed that year, but even before I started that year, was informed by the sponsoring hospital that there was no chance of being offered permanent residency. I took the one year internship job, & so I had to continue with residency application processes as soon as I started work. During the year internship XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, I paid about 60 % of my gross salary to student loan payments, somewhere about {$2400.00} per month. When that work year ended, I received unemployment for some time, & paid at least 60 % ( {$1200.00} per month ) of all my unemployment benefits monthly for about XXXX years. Unemployment ran out, but I was completely unable to gain employment. I diligently kept SallieMaeI informed in writing of my employment & income situations the entire time. Near the end of the unemployment benefits period, I informed SallieMae that their automatic debits must stop because I had no income, & no assets from which to draw. However, SallieMae continued to make auto debits for 2 or 3 months, and left me with no cash for food, rent, & living expenses. After multiple phone calls & letters, SallieMae reinstated XXXX of those month 's payments back into my account. After that, my bank required me to cancel the checking account & start a new one, because SallieMae repeated the auto debit incidents. However, this is not my major complaint. Since then, my government backed student loans have kept in good standing only because of the Income based payment plan option, for which I am grateful. The major complaint : Since then, SallieMae foreclosed on my private student loans. SallieMae received a complete payoff from the guarantor for the balance of my private student loans. Although SallieMae recognizes that the loans were paid off in full by the guarantor, SallieMae continues to proceed with collection processes, & additional interest, collection, & etc. fees & charges, through it 's spin -- off & collection agency companies. I paid a guarantor for guarantee service & when I signed, I never anticipated any chance of needing the guarantor 's pay off for my loans. However, I never signed, & would never have agreed to double indemnity on my loans. Since SallieMae has already collected account balances for my private student loans, SallieMae has gained much profit & no loss on my loans, even though I defaulted. SallieMae 's XXXX collecting on such loans is unethical greedy business, & completely immoral. I had no choices in the matter of my inability to pay off the private student loans because I had no income or assets from which to draw. If I had the ability to pay the private loans, I would have done so. When SallieMae foreclosed on loans & accepted the guarantor 's payments, my credit history was permanently affected. Now, SallieMae is working to gain XXXX profit on private loans from borrowers who could not afford even the normal single indemnity. Given my poor financial situation, SallieMae 's double indemnity & double profiteering is not just unethical business, but also criminal since it prays on folks who have the least financial resources & least ability to pay. SallieMae should be prohibited from infringing such double indemnity & double profiteering.

In the release of the news, according to the Washington XXXX,  Wells Fargo will consider lowering the interest rate of any borrower who can demonstrate hardship '' and that Wells Fargo will  reduce interest rates to as little a 1 % for a few months or the life of the loan, depending on the borrower 's circumstances ''. By the time I heard this news, I had already been struggling with my Wells Fargo student loan payment for nearly a year. I had recently applied to Wells Fargo 's pilot loan modification program, showing them that my student loan payment took nearly half of my take home pay. However I was denied, because Wells Fargo asserted that my cosigner could make the full payment. When we explained that my cosigner was burdened by medical bills, as XXXX immediate family members were in permanent XXXX, Wells Fargo said they do not take medical expenses into account when assessing hardship. I followed up with Wells Fargo after they announced the expansion of their modification program, as I could surely show prove that my Wells Fargo Student loan payments were a financial hardship. I was denied again because Wells Fargo insisted that my cosigner could make the full payment. Wells Fargo continued to refuse to work with me. They said that my only option was to refinance. When I expressed concern over losing my option to an  in-school forbearance '', as Wells Fargo Consolidation Loans do not have in-school forbearance options, an employee at the executive office told me that some borrowers who were returning to school were being allowed to refinance and keep their rights to an in-school forbearance as long as they were registered for school. However I was n't returning to school for a year. The employee went to a board with my case to see if I could keep me in-school forbearance on a consolidation loan like some other borrowers were able to, but I was denied. It 's troubling that certain borrowers are receiving options and other 's are n't. I also explained to Wells Fargo that I no longer have access to a cosigner. My father could not cosign for a consolidation loan due to his financial hardship. I applied for a Wells Fargo consolidation loan without a cosigner, and was denied, despite have a credit score of XXXX, a clean credit report,, and having always made my student loan payments on time. Thus, the only option Wells Fargo offered was not a solution after all. I was willing to work with Wells Fargo, but it was Wells Fargo that refused to work towards a mutually satisfactory payment with me. Luckily, I was able to refinance my student loan with another lender, and am thankfully no longer a customer to Wells Fargo. Needless to say after that experience I will never do business with Wells Fargo again. Although I am no longer a customer to Wells Fargo, I want to share the reality of this  modification program '', and how few people it will actually apply to. It is clear that the Wells Fargo 's student loan modification program was just a PR move, a preemptive measure to take the wind out of the sails of activists, regulators, and legislatures who were fighting to help distressed borrowers. Wells Fargo said that their program would reach XXXX borrowers. That is but a fraction of the {$11.00} XXXX in student loans that Wells Fargo services. over 90 % of Wells Fargo student loans have cosigners, so the vast majority of distressed borrowers will continue to be refused assistance, If Wells Fargo continues to refuse to work with borrowers, the CFPB and other regulatory agencies need take action to help distressed borrowers.

I could not afford $ 350+ per month for this massive debt without a job and without an income.

I 'm doing what I can, but clearly it is n't enough. The flip side to that is that I did n't land a job in the field that I graduated from. I 'm using what I did go to school for just a little bit. In all reality, I could 've just purchased software and used trial and error to figure this thing out. Now I 'm stuck paying this super huge amount of money back and the only thing I feel like was actually worth asking for a loan was the living expense that helped me get started in a new city as a young adult. At this point, I 'm sure I 've paid off that amount of living. In all reality, I do n't believe that XXXX XXXX University is worth taking out this much debt unless you already have something established prior to attending. After doing research and hearing the amount of complaints with this school and the graduation rate ... the proof is there.

At the young age of XXXX I really did not know what taking out a loan would mean for me nor had I ever dealt with any kind of debt before. There was no education given to me about what the consequences would be taking out a loan this large and I had no idea what would await for me once I graduated. I did not think much of it and the entire time I was attending college I thought I would just be using my degree I paid all this money for to get a good job that paid well and easily pay back the loans in time. After graduation I soon realized that this mentality was completely incorrect. This is when I began receiving bills from NJCLASS for close to $ XXXX/month on top of the federal loan I had to pay back which about another $ XXXX/month. This was very unsettling and there was no way for me to pay this kind of money straight out of college. It was not easy to find a job after graduating and it probably took me about 1-1.5 years to even find a salary position. During this time I had tried deferring the payments until I had more income and after I could no longer defer it I was just sending as much in my payments as I could given what I was making. How is a young adult supposed to survive on their own under these conditions? I was having difficulty just paying the loans back, forget about me having enough money to buy a car, rent/buy a place to live, start a family, etc. Then just as I was about to have enough money to make these outrageous monthly payments in full I come home to find out that my XXXX loans had defaulted and were sent to a collection agency without much warning at all. It would have been nice if they warned me that my loans were about to be sent to a lawyer 's office that would be tacking on even more money and making my payments even higher allowing for no form of consolidation or rehabilitation. This is when things really got ugly and worry and stress completely consumed my life. I had no idea what dealing with a collection agency meant for me as they mentioned that they could sue me. I started to panic and wound up seeking out a lawyer to talk to about what my options were.I found out that there was no way to rehabilitate. I do not see why the loan could not have been rehabilitated after making consecutive on time full monthly payments. The collection agency had also tacked on about an additional $ XXXX in legal fees to the total amount I owed for my XXXX loans which just seems criminal. They also said I would need to pay them $ XXXX/month now. I could n't believe what was happening to me, if I was already having trouble paying how would making me pay all this extra money help? My lawyer I was seeing told me I either had to agree to pay them the $ XXXX/month or if I could not come up with that I would have to file bankruptcy. I spent awhile mulling over if bankruptcy was the right choice for me because I was unsure how I would come up with that much money. I became so stressed out over this as I could not believe a XXXX year old had to consider bankruptcy because he chose to go to college. I kept just thinking how did my life come to this? I eventually decided I would not file bankruptcy because I did not know how that would affect the rest of my life going forward and I chose to live with my parents and basically have my entire paycheck go to this payment. This made things really hard for me because I did not have money for anything else and the stress and anxiety continued to pile up. I tried many times to work with the collection agency to see if they could lower the payments or work out an alternative payment plan but they would not budge. I am now XXXX and I am still forced to live with my parents and unable to move forward with my life. How can no rehabilitation program be offered? I can not move forward with my life in this situation.

For a small portion of my tuition, I was able to receive federal loans, but the majority I had to apply for private loans - this goes for the original years worth of standard training, as well as my extended training. My only choice at the time was to go through SallieMae, and I had cosigners who helped me attain the loans. Upon graduation I was able to enjoy the grace period and began making payments afterwards. I worked for about 4 months before I lost my XXXX job. I was able to get a job by the end of the same month, but was making substantially less. I was making payments to SallieMae at the time without issue. Times grew harder, and the decreased pay really began to catch up with me. I picked up a XXXX job, but was still struggling to make payments on all my loans, as well as necessities for daily living. I requested forbearance with SallieMae, to which they complied. I was given 3 months grace until I had to make payments again. During those three months, I received multiple calls with SallieMae telling me that I was past due by one full month, or two full months, and they were demanding payment. Each time I would inform them that I had already signed up for forbearance and that I was n't to make payments until the end of that period. They would tell me that they would make note of it and the call would end. I received these calls XXXX or XXXX a month during the forbearance period, and worse, so did my cosigners. My cosigners would be forced into making payments because they were unaware of the conditions of the forbearance. I would call SallieMae and request that they stop collecting payment and asked why they were doing so when my loans were clearly in forbearance, even my online profile listed the document that explained the terms and conditions of the forbearance. After that period of forbearance ended, I made payments for month but still needed more time and reenlisted in forbearance for a XXXX time. Another XXXX months with the same issues - debt collection calls, claims that I am past due and have a delinquent account, and my cosigners would also receive the same calls. The issues persisted throughout the forbearance and after the last month I began to make payments again, as necessary, for 4 months. At this time, I received a degradation to my pay, and was earning even less money. I could not comfortably meet the payment requirements and requested an additional forbearance period. I was informed this was the last time I could enroll in forbearance, but I had no choice and agreed. At this time, I enlisted XXXX loans under SallieMae at the same time. My cosigner received many calls stating that I was delinquent on the account and payment was necessary, to which they would pay, and I was misinformed in the fact that XXXX loan was put into forbearance before the other. To my understanding I had to make a payment on XXXX loans and that XXXX would go into forbearance at the same time, and payments would resume in XXXX. After XXXX, my account was listed as delinquent with a past due payment of {$500.00}, which I could not pay at the time and was far above my standard payment. I inquired to it and was given the explanation that XXXX loan went into forbearance before the other and that my only option was to pay off the amount. I had received no statement for the account for the month of XXXX, and a statement is n't even listed on my SallieMae account profile. The same goes for XXXX.

Upon graduation, I had over {$130000.00} in combined private loans and federal loans.

They told me before I took out the loans to attend the college, that they would help me find a job upon graduation. When I was in my last few semesters before graduating, the director of the career development office discouraged me from seeking internships outside of career development office, and to only focus on the internships through the school program. I realized after applying to multiple internships through the college and not receiving any internship offers while in college, that I had been given terrible advice by the college.

I feel lied to by my college, mislead and sold a fantasy in order to have students pay their massive tuition. For the past 6 years after graduating I have been struggling just to pay my rent and basic needs, when if I had been hired for full-time work in my field, I could be contributing to improving the economy.

Especially for students that graduated shortly before and after the great recession began in 2008. The president bailed out the banks and XXXX XXXX financial leaders, who are now becoming even more wealthy and powerful. Our government has done nothing of significance to help the students with debt to rebound from the fall of our economy. If student loan debt was forgiven in large part, I believe that our middle class would grow stronger again.
